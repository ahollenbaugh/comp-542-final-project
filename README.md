# comp-542-final-project

This is a rough implementation of the machine learning-based malware detection architecture for self-driving cars proposed in [this paper](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2020/3035741/). In this project, we first apply the Improved Feature Selection (IFS) algorithm to a dataset, then we perform k-fold cross validation (75% training, 25% testing) on a scikit-learn model.
